# Kjell-Arne Neshagen - Portfolio

A project site for offering healthy food to working people.

## Description

This project was built to be my personal portfolio. 
It contains a one page site, with the following sections:

- About Me
- My Portfolio
- Contact Me

## Built With

This site is build using React.js and Tailwindcss. 

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sovak3441/portfolio-react.git
```
### Running

1. Navigate to the cloned folder and run:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start the project in development mode using:
```bash
npm start
```
### Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
